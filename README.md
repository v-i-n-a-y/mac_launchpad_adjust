# Mac Launchpad Adjust

This is a python script to adjust the launchpad icon size in place of running terminal commands

Download the file name "mac_launchpad_adjust.py" and run it using the command "python3 mac_launchpad_adjust.py"

You will get 3 options:
1. Adjust rows and columns 
    - This will then ask for the number of rows and then the number of columns. A dip  in brightness of the display is to be expected when this runs
2. Reset icon size only 
    - This will only reset the icon size
3. Reset icon size and order 
    - This will reset both icon size and order i.e factory reset
